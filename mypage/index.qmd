In his book How to Be a Modern Scientist, Jeff Leek talks about the juggling act that comes with a scientific career. His "Career Planning" chapter dives into handling multiple responsibilities—a struggle that feels all too familiar if you're balancing life as a doctor and a researcher.

As a neurologist treating Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, and a researcher digging into deep brain stimulation (DBS) and genetic profiling, I live this balancing act every day. Taking care of patients means being precise and compassionate, while research demands curiosity and patience. Switching back and forth between these two worlds? It's rewarding—but also exhausting.

Leek suggests focusing on priorities and setting clear boundaries. For me, that means carving out time for research while staying fully present with my patients. Some days, the clinic takes over; other days, a research breakthrough grabs the spotlight. It’s a constant dance.

One of the best pieces of advice from Leek’s chapter is to focus on work that really matters. For me, that means zeroing in on research that directly improves patient care. When my research and clinical work align, it feels meaningful—and that keeps me going, even on the tough days.

Balancing both roles isn’t a walk in the park. There are late nights spent analyzing data after a busy clinic and weekends dedicated to writing up findings. But having a foot in both worlds gives me a unique perspective and pushes me to keep improving care for my patients.

Jeff Leek’s advice is a good reminder: balancing these careers is hard work, but it’s worth it. Embracing both sides—medicine and research—helps me grow and stay motivated to make a real difference.
